  <center> <h1> A Weekend Guide to Santa Barbara </h1>
    <p>
      It's time to take a trip to the Riviera! The American Riviera. We're heading to Santa Barbara, California for the weekend!

      The gorgeous city of Santa Barbara, which sits along a south-facing curve of California, has so much to offer visitors. Coastal views with a backdrop of the mountains, old Spanish style architecture throughout the town, a bustling and thriving culinary scene, luxurious resorts and spas, trendy art-filled neighborhoods, and so much more. Come here once and I guarantee you'll be leaving with your second visit already planned!

Santa Barbara is a perfect destination for families, couples, and even solo travelers of all ages and backgrounds. Use this travel guide to plan your trip and find out where to eat, where to stay, and what to do in Santa Barbara during your visit.
If you're looking for places to eat in Santa Barbara, rest assured, you will not be leaving hungry. This city is full of so many wonderful places to eat with all different types of cuisines, ambiances, and experiences that it will even appease the pickiest of foodies.

    <ul> BUDGET:
      Pickles & Swiss, 811 State Street, Ste E -- Really tasty sandwiches and melts
      McConnell's Fine Ice Creams, 728 State Street -- Santa Barbara's very own and some of the best ice cream you'll ever have
      The Blue Owl, 5 W Canon Perdido
      On The Alley, 117 Harbor Way
      Persona Wood Fired Pizzeria, 905 State Street -- Try the Chipotle Chicken Pizza and thank me later (It won a pizza contest award in Italy!)
      Also try: C'est Cheese (absolutely must go), Santa Barbara Public Market (my personal favorite inside is Empty Bowl), Renaud's Patisserie, or Mony's Mexican Food. </ul></p>
